Define all languages used in your product data here. That will be the languages available for translatable product attributes.

## Settings

|Form field |Description |
--- | ---
|Language |Product data language 
|Fallback language |If no data is provided, we'll use this fallback language

### Fallback Languages
Fallback languages are great if you want to "overwrite" just some attribute values and don't want to translate others.

#### Region Specifics

|Language |Fallback language |
--- | ---
|English (GB) | -
|English (US) | English (GB)

Now you can provide separate content in American English but for most products the British English content might be fine.
