# Setup Options

When you sign up for a new account, we'll offer different setup options.

## Empty Account

The heavendata platform is fully customizable. If you start with an empty account, you have to do the product database setup manually
before you can add or import products, this option is recommended if you have a clear picture of your product attributes and how they should be organized.

## Default Settings

We'll create essential attributes and one product type "simple product" for you. You can optimize and enhance this setting later at any time.

If you chose to start with default settings, you're ready to add or import products right from the start. This is the recommended option for most accounts.

## Managed Setup

Setting up full-blown product information management systems can be challenging; that's why our team is ready to do the setup for you.

Let's talk about what you need and find the perfect solution together.
