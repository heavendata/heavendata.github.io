# Background Jobs

Here you'll find a list of running and finished background jobs with results.

Depending on the size of you product catalog, some tasks may take some time to complete. This includes import, export or update operations. For this reason we run those tasks in the background and it's safe to close your browser or shutdown your PC.

## Job Results

Each job execution ends with a summary log that includes a high level overview what was done. If there are any problems you'll find additional information in the attached log files.
