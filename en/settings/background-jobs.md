# Background Jobs

Here you'll find a list of running and finished background jobs with results.

Depending on the size of your product catalog, some tasks may take some time to complete. This includes import, export or update operations. For this reason, we run those tasks in the background and it's safe to close your browser or shut down your PC.

## Job Results

Each job execution ends with a summary log that includes a high-level overview of what was done. If there are any problems, you'll find additional information in the attached log files.
