# Account Administration Overview

Our platform provides a rich set of administration features including

* Sub accounts
* User permission management
* Support for agencies and consultants

Let's have a look at the building blocks...

## Users and Logins
Each user represents a single person. There are no shared logins supported. Each user can have access to multiple heavendata.com accounts.

## Organizations
An organization represents a heavendata.com customer. That's where things like billing addresses and tax-related settings are stored.

## (Sub) Accounts
Each account is a fully separated PIM database. An organization has at least one account. Use additional accounts if you need a separate playground database or need separated accounts for multiple departments or customers.

## Organization Memberships
Users can have access to multiple organizations and their accounts. If a user has access to an organization, we call him a member. You can invite new or existing users to join your organization, which will make them members.

## User Groups
Each organization can have user groups for permission management. This allows you to configure permissions at a central place instead of managing them for each user separately.
