# Data Center

## Location

Our solution is hosted by Azure in Europe.

## Our IP Address

Requests initiated from our production systems will use the IP address: 40.119.145.134

Please be aware that the IP address used for outgoing requests may change without prior notice. Ensure that your firewall and network configurations are set to accommodate potential changes. Regularly verify your settings to maintain uninterrupted service.

Please DO NOT restrict the access to test systems by IP. If you restrict the access to test systems, we're no longer able to analyze eventual issues that need investigation from the engineering team.
