# Product Attributes

Goal of a product information management system is to be the single source of truth for all your product data in best possible quality. You can store text information, product relations and other data types as well as binary assets and categories.

This document describes what attributes are and how to manage them.

## Concept
It's important to have all peaces of information information in dedicated fields. We call this fields "product attributes". Common examples for attributes are "product name", "width", "price", "color", ... If you're working with Excel or databases, one product attribute will store the data of one column in a worksheet.

Note: Do not add all those data in one single text attribute. Prefer one attribute for each fact.

### Attribute Sections
An attribute is always part of one attribute section. Just a group for better readability.

Example:

* Section "Technical details" with attributes "power consumption", "voltage", ...
* Section "Common" with "name", "long description", "short description", "price", ...
