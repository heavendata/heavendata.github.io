# Common Attributes

Attributes that will be available for all products of any product type.

Typically creating attributes needs two steps: 1) create the attribute (in attributes & sections) then 2) enable the attribute in all product types where it should be visible. Now imagine you want a new attribute that you need in all product types and you have 100 product types - this would take some time. That's the reason why we have these "common attributes". Now you create the new attribute and enable it here. That's all.
